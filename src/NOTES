Method vs Function

->A method is also a function but always inside or associated with a class .
->A function is a standalone method that can reside outside a class and still work.
-->Java does not support standalone functions.


Argument vs Parameters

->Arguments are the real values that we pass when call a method;
->Parameters are the variables defined inside the function definition.


Primitive vs non primitive argument passing:

==>In java whenever we pass an variable , then always the value of that variable is passed , irrespective of the value type

-->In case of a primitive type , the variable directly stores the value inside it and is present in the stack memory
    --> Hence , it  just  passes a value

-->In case of a non-primitive type , the variable stores the reference address to the actual object in the heap
    and the object stores the actual value
      -->Hence we pass an address of the actual object and the original object's value can be manipulated
